# Notes on Open Policy Agent

The Open Policy Agent (OPA, pronounced “oh-pa”) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. You can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more.

> OPA is a lightweight general-purpose policy engine that can be co-located with your service. You can integrate OPA as a sidecar, host-level daemon, or library.

> Services offload policy decisions to OPA by executing queries. OPA evaluates policies and data to produce query results (which are sent back to the client). Policies are written in a high-level declarative language and can be loaded dynamically into OPA remotely via APIs or through the local filesystem.

OPA decouples policy decision-making from policy enforcement.

OPA generates policy decisions by evaluating the query input against policies and data. OPA and Rego are domain-agnostic so you can describe almost any kind of invariant in your policies. For example:

- Which users can access which resources.
- Which subnets egress traffic is allowed to.
- Which times of day the system can be accessed at.

Policy decisions are not limited to simple yes/no or allow/deny answers. Like query inputs, your policies can generate arbitrary structured data as output.

OPA policies are expressed in a high-level declarative language called Rego. Rego (pronounced “ray-go”) is purpose-built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures.

To install:

```shell
brew install opa
```
You can load policy and data files into the REPL by passing them on the command line. By default, JSON and YAML files are rooted under data.

## Philosophy

A policy is a set of rules that governs the behavior of a software service. That policy could describe rate-limits, names of trusted servers or accounts a user can withdraw money from.

Authorization is a special kind of policy that often dictates which people or machines can run which actions on which resources.

Authorization is sometimes confused with Authentication: how people or machines prove they are who they say they are. Authorization and more generally policy often utilize the results of authentication (the username, user attributes, groups, claims), but makes decisions based on far more information than just who the user is. 

Today policy is often a hard-coded feature of the software service it actually governs. Open Policy Agent lets you decouple policy from that software service so that the people responsible for policy can read, write, analyze, version, distribute, and in general manage policy separate from the service itself.

### What is Policy?

Policies are set of rules essential to the long-term success of organizations because they encode important knowledge about how to comply with legal requirements, work within technical constraints, avoid repeating mistakes, and so on.

### What is Policy Decoupling?

Software services should allow policies to be specified declaratively, updated at any time without recompiling or redeploying, and enforced automatically.

### OPA Document Model

OPA policies (written in Rego) make decisions based on hierarchical structured data. Sometimes we refer to this data as a document, set of attributes, piece of context, or even just “JSON”.

- OPA policies can make decisions based on arbitrary structured data.
- OPA itself is not tied to any particular domain model.
- OPA policies can represent decisions as arbitrary structured data (e.g., booleans, strings, maps, maps of lists of maps, etc.)

Data can be loaded into OPA from outside world using push or pull interfaces that operate synchronously or asynchronously with respect to policy evaluation. We refer to all data loaded into OPA from the outside world as base documents. These base documents almost always contribute to your policy decision-making logic.
However, your policies can also make decisions based on each other. Policies almost always consist of multiple rules that refer to other rules (possibly authored by different groups). In OPA, we refer to the values generated by rules (a.k.a., decisions) as virtual documents. The term “virtual” in this case just means the document is computed by the policy, i.e., it’s not loaded into OPA from the outside world.
